                - **Character Description Accuracy**: Assess if the character descriptions in the prompt accurately reflect the details provided (such as appearance, age, clothing, etc.). Ensure the age is specified directly (e.g., "20-year-old female" rather than "young female") and provide critique if this format is not followed. Highlight any deviations or areas for improvement. Confirm that the character’s action or expression aligns with the context and description provided, ensuring consistency in physical and emotional portrayal. If additional characters are mentioned, provide critique to limit the prompt to a single main character.

                - **Location Description Accuracy**: Evaluate if the location details accurately match the provided description. Confirm that the environment, setting elements, and atmosphere are in line with the story’s context. Note any missing or incorrect elements and suggest improvements to ensure the setting aligns with the intended scene and mood.

                - **Alignment with Context and Action**: Check that both the character’s action and the location accurately reflect the context and narrative details provided. The prompt should seamlessly integrate the character’s behavior or expression with the location, time of day, and any atmospheric elements, enhancing immersion and visual consistency.

                - **Adherence to Context, Word Limit, and Format**: Ensure the prompt maintains the specified theme (e.g., fantasy, sci-fi) and stays within the word limit. Suggest adjustments if the prompt is too lengthy or lacks focus.

                - **Strict Format Requirement**: Confirm that the output prompt is presented as a single, uninterrupted block of text with no extra lines, subheadings, or additional text. This is essential for usability in image generation tools.

                - **Context Description Accuracy**: Ensure that the context provided is well-described within the image prompt. The prompt should accurately reflect the situational and environmental details outlined in the context, enhancing the scene's authenticity and relevance.

                Provide specific recommendations to improve clarity, visual appeal, and alignment with the original descriptions, noting any additional elements necessary for enhancing the prompt. Ensure the feedback helps the prompt remain concise, visually engaging, and consistent with the scene and character details in the story's context."""

            - Emphasize key visual elements, atmosphere, and character details relevant to the scene.
            - Describe the scene contextually with respect to the story or scene rather than relying on stylistic cues like "photography scene."

If the exact phrase or title is missing, note it in the critique.

            - **Color Theme**: Evaluate if the suggested color theme aligns with a movie poster or YouTube thumbnail aesthetic. The color scheme should be bold, engaging, and support the video’s tone, ensuring it is visually appealing and eye-catching on the platform.

            - **Thumbnail Composition and Style**: Review the prompt for a clear and visually compelling composition. The thumbnail should be dynamic and attention-grabbing, suitable for the YouTube platform.

            - Carefully analyze the provided character and story information to understand the essence of the narrative and its key themes.

Include the phrase "with text 'youtube_title'" to specify the exact title text that should be visually integrated. Describe the title placement and suggest a unique style that stands out. The title font should be large, distinct, and visually integrated into the scene.
            - **Color Theme**: Choose a vibrant color scheme that enhances the thumbnail’s appeal and resonates with the story’s tone. Aim for a movie-poster quality palette that will pop on the YouTube platform.
            - **Composition and Style**: Create a dynamic, balanced layout that draws the viewer’s eye to key elements. Use strong visual contrasts and focal points that highlight the characters and main plot elements. The thumbnail should feel cinematic and polished, echoing the style of a high-quality movie poster.

Ensure the revised version addresses all points raised, enhancing the title clarity, color theme, or other elements as indicated. Double-check that all feedback is reflected effectively in the updated prompt to optimize the thumbnail’s visual impact.

            Example: Design a surreal and chaotic movie poster for "Fear and Loathing in Moscow," blending elements of dark humor and the unpredictable atmosphere of a foreign city. The central figure is a man in a disheveled suit, wearing round sunglasses and a fur hat, with a crazed look on his face. The background is a distorted, neon-lit version of Moscow's Red Square, with iconic landmarks like St. Basil's Cathedral twisted and warped as if in a dream or hallucination. The sky is swirling with psychedelic colors—bright reds, purples, and greens—creating a sense of confusion and mania. The title "Fear and Loathing in Moscow" should be written in wild, erratic fonts, with splashes of color, capturing the chaotic, offbeat tone of the film, with text "Fear and Loathing in Moscow."
